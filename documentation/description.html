<h2 id="our-goal">Our Goal</h2>
<strong>We want to enable all players to quickly create, customize and select good rune pages based on automatically generated recommendations to improve the overall quality of used rune pages.</strong>
</div>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Creating rune pages can be quite tedious - especially for low elo players. To quickly create new rune page, a player has to memorize the effects of each rune. The current solution for many players is to copy the rune pages other players use e.g. from <a href="probuilds.net" class="uri">probuilds.net</a></p>
<p>This process takes relatively long: there might not be enough time to create the rune page in champ select</p>
<h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2>
<p>We built a machine learning model to generate rune pages for a champion and lane combination. The player only has to enter these two parameters to receive a customizable rune page. We help the player by providing a base line model for his rune page. If the player wishes to customize it, he’s free to do so, but he can also just use the rune page generated by our model.</p>
<p>A key feature of our application is the League Client Update integration. If the player downloads our Electron App and generates a rune page, he can insert the page into the client and set it as active with one click. This approach is far faster than copying a rune page from another player by hand.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>In the future we want to integrate more tightly with the LCU: With the internal API we could automatically detect the champion and lane chosen by the player. Additional input parameters for our models such as the champions of both teams could also be automatically extracted, enabling more accurate predictions with less overhead for the player.</p>
